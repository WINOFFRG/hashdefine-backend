All our children deserve a chance to become creators instead of consumers of Computer Science.” – Maria Klawe #define was established on 4 September 2019 to help consumers become creators. Since then, the society has touched the lives of 400+ individuals through various events and helped them become successful programmers.At #define, we stand with thousands of students who wish to learn how to code, with those for whom learning is motivated by a fascination for new technologies, and with those who wish to speak code faster than their language.</p><p>We aim to lay the foundations of a tightly knit community that learns and grows together, and with all the people who have joined us, we are sure that we are not that far.</p></div><div class="image-holder"><img src="assets/images/saly-15.svg"/></div></div></div>
